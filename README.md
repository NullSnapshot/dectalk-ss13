This is a FonixTalk (Formerly known as DecTalk) wrapper for ss13.

It uses: 

[SharpTalk](https://github.com/whatsecretproject/SharpTalk) For the C# program which reads scripts/voicequeue.txt in the ss13 folder (where the dmb is located) which is written to by ss13.

[WinVorbis](http://www.stationplaylist.com/winvorbis/) for OggEnc to convert the generated .wav to .ogg for saving bandwidth, you could skip this if you felt like it. OggEnc goes where dmb is.
